# machinelearning-regression

This is an excercise that contains an example of linear regression.
I used a dataset with information about penguins. The result is a prediction of the body mass using phisical and geographic attributes of them

**Phases:**

1 - Exploratory inspection

2 - NAN values handling

3 - Data standardization (numerical and categorical attributes - using one hot encoding)

4 - Data cleaning

5 - Model training

6 - Model test

7 - Model evaluation

8 - Prediction
